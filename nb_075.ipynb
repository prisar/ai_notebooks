        "**Q: How effective is layer-wise adaptive distillation in improving student model robustness compared to standard knowledge distillation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**A:** Based on the experiment, layer-wise adaptive distillation is highly effective at improving student model robustness against FGSM adversarial attacks. The adaptively trained model maintained an accuracy of **59.47%** under attack, whereas the baseline model's accuracy plummeted to **17.56%**. This demonstrates a significant improvement in adversarial resilience.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: What is the trade-off between in-distribution accuracy and adversarial robustness observed in this experiment?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**A:** A clear trade-off was observed. The baseline model, trained with standard knowledge distillation, achieved a much higher in-distribution accuracy on the clean test set (**62.88%**) compared to the adaptively trained model (**16.53%**). However, the adaptive model showed far superior robustness to adversarial attacks. This suggests that the adaptive distillation method, in this specific training configuration, prioritized learning robust features at the expense of performance on the standard, unperturbed data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The baseline student model, trained with standard knowledge distillation, achieved an in-distribution accuracy of **62.88%**.\n",
        "*   The student model trained with adaptive layer-wise distillation showed a significantly lower in-distribution accuracy of **16.53%**. This was likely due to an unstable training process, as indicated by the erratic loss values observed during training.\n",
        "*   Under an FGSM adversarial attack (with epsilon=0.05), the baseline model's accuracy dropped dramatically to **17.56%**.\n",
        "*   The adaptively trained model demonstrated significantly better adversarial robustness, maintaining an accuracy of **59.47%** under the same FGSM attack.\n",
        "*   A clear trade-off was identified: the baseline model had better in-distribution performance, while the adaptive model had superior adversarial robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The training instability of the adaptive model (indicated by large negative loss values) should be investigated. Tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate, the `alpha` parameter for loss balancing, or adding constraints to the learnable layer weights could lead to a model that is both accurate on clean data and robust to attacks.\n",
        "*   Further evaluation should be conducted using a wider range of adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD) and other robustness metrics (e.g., performance on noisy or corrupted data) to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the adaptive distillation method's effectiveness.\n"
